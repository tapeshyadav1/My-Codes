2. Bioinformatics Research Intern (Oct 2022-now)
   Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida 

* Isolated and cleaned big data obtained from protein sequencing (≈ 10^9 data points). Increased protein analysis speed by ≈ 10 times by using faster clustering methods (from sklearn), applying feature engineering and improved sampling methods (using KL-Divergence)Isolated and cleaned big data from protein sequencing (≈ 10^9 data points).
